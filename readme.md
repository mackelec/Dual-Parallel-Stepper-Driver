## Dual - Parallel Stepper Driver Module


![Parallel Stepper Driver Module](https://github.com/mackelec/Dual-Parallel-Stepper-Driver/blob/main/dualStepperDriver.PNG)


Simple PCB - module which parallels the EN, DIR, STEP signals to drive two standard Stepper Modules.
This is used if you want to drive two stepper motors simultaneously.

#### Features

 - Jumpers to swap Motor Direction
 - Jumpers for Micro-Stepping.
 - On-Board 3.3V regulator.
 - Connector for Motor Power Supply (12V,24V etc)
 - Second, paralleled input connector, allow daisy chaining to another parallel module so you could drive four motors and so on.

#### PCB

 - PCB is ready to order from www.jlcpcb.com .  
 - Upload Gerber_PCB_dualStepperDriver.zip
